Any folders here are compiled as part of build_game_and_plugins.bat
which is faster than compiling plugins individually from their separate repos.
Plugin libs are output to "SevenKewp/build/output/" alongside the game lib.

Open a shell in this folder and clone plugin repos to add them to the build. Example:
git clone https://github.com/wootguy/SevenKewp_plugins

Plugins often need to be rebuilt whenever the mod is updated.
